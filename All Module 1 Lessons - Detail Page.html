                  <br>
                  <h4>Moral Standards</h4></a>
                  <p div="description">
                    • Moral standards are those concerned with or relating to human behavior , especially the distinction between good and bad behavior. Moral standards involves the rules people have about the kinds of actions they believe are morally right and wrong.            
              <p>• According to some scholars, moral standards are the sum of combined norms and values. In 
other words, norms plus values equal moral standards. On the one hand, norms are
understood as general rules about our actions or behaviors. On the other hand, values are understood as enduring beliefs or 
statements about what is good and desirable or not. 
                <div></div>
              <br><h5>Characteristics of Moral Standards:</h5></a>
<p>Moral standards have the following characteristics, namely: 
<p>1) Moral standards deal with matters we think can seriously injure or benefit humans, animals, 
and the environment, such as child abuse, rape, and murder; 
<p>2) Moral standards are not 
established or changed by the decisions of authoritative individuals or bodies. Indeed, moral 
standards rest on the adequacy of the reasons that are taken to support and justify them. For 
sure, we don’t need a law to back up our moral conviction that killing innocent people is 
absolutely wrong; 
<p>3) Moral standards are overriding, that is, they take precedence over other 
standards and considerations, especially of self-interest; 
<p>4) Moral standards are based on 
impartial considerations. Hence, moral standards are fair and just; and 
<p>5) Moral standards are 
associated with special emotions (such as guilt and shame) and vocabulary (such as right, 
wrong, good, and bad)
                    
                    <br><br><h5>Examples:</h5></a>
                    <p>- Force others to act accordingly
                    <p>- Helping the poor is good
                    <p>- Cheating during exams is bad
                      <div>
                      </div>
                      <br><h4>Non-Moral Standards</h4></a>
                      <p div="description"></p>
                    <p>• Non-moral standards refer to rules that are unrelated to moral or ethical considerations. Either these standards are not necessarily linked to morality or by nature lack ethical sense. 
                    <p>• Non-moral standards refer to standards by which we judge what is good or bad and right or 
                      wrong in a non-moral way.
                      <div></div>
              <br>
                    <p>As we can see, non-moral standards are matters of taste or preference. Hence, a scrupulous 
                      observance of these types of standards does not make one a moral person. Violation of said 
                      standards also does not pose any threat to human well-being. 
                    <p>Finally, as a way of distinguishing moral standards from non-moral ones, if a moral standard 
                      says “Do not harm innocent people” or “Don’t steal”, a non-moral standard says “Don’t text 
                      while driving” or “Don’t talk while the mouth is full”.</p>

                   
                    <br><h5>Examples:</h5></a>
                    <p>- Standards of etiquette by which we judge manners as good or bad
                    <p>- Standards we call the law by which we judge something as legal or illegal
                    <p>- standards of aesthetics by which we judge art as good or rubbish

          <a><h3>What are Dilemmas?</h3></a>
          <br>
          <h4>Dilemmas</h4></a>
            <p div="description">
              <p>• It is a situation where a person is forced to choose between two or more conflicting options, neither of which is acceptable.</p>
              <p>• It is also known as ethical dilemma (ethical paradox or moral dilemma) which is a problem in 
                the decision-making process between two possible options, neither of which is 
                absolutely acceptable from an ethical perspective. Although we face many ethical 
                and moral problems in our lives, most of them come with relatively straightforward 
                solutions.
                On the other hand, ethical dilemmas are extremely complicated challenges that 
                cannot be easily solved. Therefore, the ability to find the optimal solution in such
                situations is critical to everyone.
                Every person may encounter an ethical dilemma in almost every aspect of their life, 
                including personal, social, and professional.</p>  
                <br><h5>Examples:</h5></a>
                <p>- Taking credit for others’ work
                <p>- Offering a client a worse product for your own profit
                <p>- Utilizing inside knowledge for your own profit</p>
                <div>

        <div class="description">
        <a><h3>Types of Moral Dilemmas</h3></a>
        <br>
        <h4>1. Epistemic</h4></a>
          <p div="description">
            <p>Epistemic moral dilemmas involve situations wherein two or more moral requirements conflict with each other and that the moral agent hardly knows which of the conflicting moral requirements takes precedence over the other. In other words, the moral agent here does not know which option is morally right or wrong.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>2. Self-Imposed Dilemma</h4></a>
          <p div="description">
            <p>A self-imposed dilemma is one created by the agent's own errors in judgment, such as making competing promises to multiple organizations that cannot be fulfilled simultaneously.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>3. Obligation Dilemmas</h4></a>
          <p div="description">
            <p>Type obligation dilemmas are situations in which more than one action type is obligatory, but the conjunction of the actions types is not feasible.
